# Equation Learning for COVASIM with added Adaptive Behaviors using Biologically-Informed Neural Networks

All equation learning and BINNs code has been adapted from [1.] and Xin Li xli86@ncsu.edu.

All code under the folder /covasim is the work of the ***["Institute for Disease Modeling"](https://github.com/InstituteforDiseaseModeling/covasim)***.
